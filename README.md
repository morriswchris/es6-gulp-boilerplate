# ES6 Gulp Boilerplate
> The Easiest way to get started with ES6 and Gulp

The ES6 Gulp Boilerplate was designed to as an easy way to get started writing ES6 javascript thanks to the ES6-Bable project. The boilerplate contains:

- [x] ES6 compilation step thanks to gulp-babel, and moving to the corresponding `app/js` directory
- [x] Copying of src html files to the `app` directory
- [x] localhost webserver located at `localhost:8080`
- [x] dynamic copying of changed filed through the `watch` profile

## Dependencies
- `npm`
- `npm install -g gulp`

## Install

1. `git clone git@github.com:morriswchris/es6-gulp-boilerplate.git <app_name>`
2. `cd <app_name>`
3. Install the dependancies using `npm install`
4. run `gulp` to start the server

## Inspiration

This boilerplate was inspired through all the talks related to migrating to ES6. After consistently being lazy to start learning ES6 due to barrier to entry, I decided it was time to build a boilerplate that I can start basing front-end projects off of instead of just ordinary JS files.
